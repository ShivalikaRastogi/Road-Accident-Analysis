# Road-Accident-Analysis
In this Dashboard,I've created a comprehensive view of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The objective was to provide valuable insights to clients and shed light on accident trends. Here's a glimpse of my approach:

üîç Data Gathering & Cleaning:
I imported the CSV file and performed various activities such as applying filters, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analyzable format. The data includes information about accidents, such as the number of vehicles involved, severity of the accident, and the location and time of the accident.


üîÑ Data Processing:
Creating some new columns that involved organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to extract meaningful insights.


üìä Data Analysis: 
Used various statistical methods to get valuable insights from the data.

üìà Data Visualization: 
Used Excel as a visualization tool. With the help of this, I have created attractive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals to present the data in an easy way.

üîÑ Dashboard Making: 
Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel by inserting slicers and timelines that allow users to interact with the data.

## Introduction
* This project is aimed at developing a Power BI Dashboard for generating insights about road accident data in the United Kingdom.

## Dashboard Requirements
* Primary KPI's - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY Growth
* Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY Growth
* Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to Vehicle Type for Current Year
* Monthly Trend showing comparison of Casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
* Casualties by Road Type for Current Year
* Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night
* Total Casualties and Total Accident by Location

## Installation / Usage
* Install Power BI Desktop from Official [Power BI Download Site](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
* Download data files from link given in Introduction
* Clone/download this repository to your local machine
* Open Dashboard report file (Road Accidents Dashboard.pbix) in Power BI Desktop, to access the dashboard's interactivity


## DAX Formulas Used in Measures

**1. Total Casualties For Current Year and Year on Year Growth**

(a) Current Year To Date Casualties -- CY Casualties Measure
* `CY Casualties = TOTALYTD(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), 'Calendar'[Date])`

(b) Previous Year Casualties -- PY Casualties Measure
* `PY Casualties = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Number_of_Casualties]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))`

(c) Year on Year Growth of Casualties - YoY Casualties Measure
* `YoY Casualties = ([CY Casualties] - [PY Casualties])/[PY Casualties]`

**2. Total Accidents for Current Year and Year on Year Growth**

(a) Current Year Accidents Count -- CY Accidents Count Measure
*  `CY Accidents Count = TOTALYTD(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), 'Calendar'[Date])`

(b) Previous Year Accidents Count -- PY Accidents Count Measure
* `PY Accidents Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Data[Accident_Index]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar'[Date]))`

(c) Year on Year Growth of Accidents - YoY Accidents Measure
* `YoY Accidents = ([CY Accidents Count]-[PY Accidents Count])/[PY Accidents Count]`
