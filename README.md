# Road-Accident-Analysis
In this Dashboard,I've created a comprehensive view of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The objective was to provide valuable insights to clients and shed light on accident trends. Here's a glimpse of my approach:

🔍 Data Gathering & Cleaning:
I imported the CSV file and performed various activities such as applying filters, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analyzable format. The data includes information about accidents, such as the number of vehicles involved, severity of the accident, and the location and time of the accident.


🔄 Data Processing:
Creating some new columns that involved organizing, sorting, and filtering the data to extract meaningful insights.


📊 Data Analysis: 
Used various statistical methods to get valuable insights from the data.

📈 Data Visualization: 
Used Excel as a visualization tool. With the help of this, I have created attractive charts, graphs, and interactive visuals to present the data in an easy way.

🔄 Dashboard Making: 
Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel by inserting slicers and timelines that allow users to interact with the data.
